# BASIC BOT FOR TELEGRAM

## [Glitch Teacher Bot](http://t.me/glitch_teacher_bot) is created with Python3 in order to show examples of functions of Telegram bots. Then read the following instructions:

## 1.- First of all, read the tutorial that is explained here -> [Tutorial](http://telegra.ph/Creando-Bots-en-Telegram-06-09)

## 2.- If you have read the explanation and followed all the steps, you can see the glitch of the bot, use this link https://github.com/boterostg/telegramBotPython and then click on View Source to see the project . You can look at functions examples and use them to create your own bot :D

## 3.- Documentation: [TELEGRAM BOT API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api) (here you have all info and functions to implement in your bot). 

## 4.- The functionalities of the bot are in [bot.py](https://github.com/boterostg/botBasicoGlitch/blob/master/bot.py) and in  [glitch proyect](https://glitch.com/~glitch-teacher-bot)

## * This project comes from the Telegram group http://t.me/boterostg. Since there are many people wanting to learn, we have decided to create a bot from scratch with https://glitch.com and Python3. The bot will be used as an example while lectures / lectures are given and little by little the code of the bot will increase. Any questions about the code or people interested in collaborating, just have to enter to the group :)

## * Thanks to https://github.com/sanguchi that created the entire structure of the project and the following tutorial on how to use it: http://telegra.ph/Creando-Bots-en-Telegram 06- 09
